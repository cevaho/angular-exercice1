# angular-exercice1

## Goal:
- testing databindings, pipes, components
- testing array data transfers between components without services
- testing imports and urls validation

an exercise made with Angular 6 in order to test the typescript and ES6
this won't work as all Angular files aren't downloaded in the repository,
if you want to run it you will have to download files in the correct folder.
